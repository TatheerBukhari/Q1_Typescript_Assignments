// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let message1:string[]=["musa","tatheer","tooba"];

for (const message2 of message1){
    console.log(`Hello ${message2} have a nice day!`);
    
}
